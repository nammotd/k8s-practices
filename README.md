# Practices K8s

* Create a deployment with [game.yaml](k8s_manifests/game.yaml)
* Delete a pod from the deployment, observe the pods again
* Scale the deployment to 20 pods
* Scale down the deployment to 5 pods
* Stop the deployment from creating more pods without delete the deployment
* Exec into the pods
